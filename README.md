# Ninja Forms Datepicker Validation

Ninja Forms only provides the option to limit the date picker form fields by year range. 
This plugin replaces the year range with a date range and provides front end and back end validation.

## Installing
This plugin Requires Ninja Forms version 3.0 or later.
Install the plugin by downloading and adding it to the plugins directory. Once added, activate the plugin from the WordPress admin panel.

## Usage
In the Ninja Forms form builder, the date field will have a `Date Range` panel under the `Advanced` settings. Enter the start date and end date. The date picker will include the start date and end date as valid options. The dates enetered must be a valid format. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#page-14. It is easiest to use the format defined in the help popup window -> MM/DD/YYYY.
